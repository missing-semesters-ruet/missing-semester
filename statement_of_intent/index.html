<p>This is a statement of intent for RUET’s version of the Missing Semesters series. This may be updated as the initiative evolves.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

<p><strong>Missing Semesters - RUET</strong> is a student-led series of practical, hands-on sessions designed to equip learners—especially ECE and CS undergraduates—with foundational computing skills often overlooked in traditional coursework.</p>

<p>While university courses focus on theory and application of specific technologies, this series fills in the crucial gap: <strong>learning how to effectively use computers as power users</strong>, especially in Linux environments. These skills will help you debug faster, collaborate better, and become more confident in navigating real-world programming and development workflows.</p>

<p>Our workshops are highly interactive and designed for absolute beginners, yet provide room to explore advanced workflows and tools.</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>

<p>This series is inspired by <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">MIT’s Missing Semester</a> and adapted from the version run at the University of Birmingham. However, our version is built specifically for <strong>RUET students</strong>, taught <strong>by capable students</strong>, for the benefit of peers across all years.</p>

<p>These sessions are organized <strong>by students, for students</strong>. The ECE Department and other supportive groups are kindly assisting us with logistical needs like classrooms and necessary facilities.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-syllabus">Workshop Syllabus</h3>

<p>Our current lineup includes the following topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Linux for Beginners</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Introduction to Git &amp; GitHub</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Markdown and Beyond the Basics of Git &amp; GitHub</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Debugging with VS Code &amp; PyCharm</strong></li>
  <li><strong>More Linux! (Intro to Bash &amp; Shell Scripting)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Open-source Collaboration with GitHub</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Security &amp; Cryptography</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Potpourri</strong> (a mixed bag of advanced tips, tricks, and topics)</li>
</ol>

<p>Workshops may evolve based on feedback and demand. Additional topics and sessions may be added in future runs.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h3>

<p>Any RUET student—first year to final year—who is interested in becoming a more effective and independent problem-solver with their computer.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working in Linux</li>
  <li>Writing better code</li>
  <li>Collaborating using Git</li>
  <li>Debugging real-world programs</li>
  <li>Contributing to open-source</li>
  <li>Understanding cryptography and digital safety</li>
</ul>

<p>…then this series is for you.</p>

<h3 id="format-and-approach">Format and Approach</h3>

<p>Workshops will be conducted <strong>in person</strong> on RUET campus in an informal, highly practical setting. All notes and materials will be made available online. We’ll also use a <strong>Discord group</strong> for questions, announcements, and discussions.</p>

<p>Each session is hosted by student instructors who have learned these tools through self-study, internships, competitive programming, or real project work. They understand the struggles of learning these concepts and will guide you step-by-step.</p>

<p>No exams. No grades. Just hands-on learning.</p>

<p>Each lecture includes live demos and optional exercises for those who want to go further.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>We recommend attending the sessions with your <strong>own laptop</strong>, preferably set up with <strong>Linux</strong> (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, or WSL2). Help will be provided to get you set up in the first session.</p>

<h3 id="statement-on-inclusivity">Statement on Inclusivity</h3>

<p>This series is open to everyone. We are committed to creating a respectful, supportive, and harassment-free learning environment. Regardless of background, gender, experience level, or department—<strong>you are welcome here</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s learn together, ask questions freely, and build a community that grows together.</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>This is the <strong>first edition</strong> of Missing Semesters at RUET, and we hope to continue and evolve it over the coming semesters. This is just the beginning. If there is interest, we may run follow-up series, dive deeper into advanced tools, or even invite guest mentors in the future. The direction will be shaped by your feedback.</p>

<p>We believe that the skills you learn here will help you <strong>beyond university</strong>—in internships, open-source, hackathons, research, or jobs.</p>

<p>Let’s fill in the gaps together!</p>
