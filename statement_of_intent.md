title: "Statement of Intent"
---

This is a statement of intent for RUET’s version of the Missing Semesters series. This may be updated as the initiative evolves.

### What is this?

**Missing Semesters - RUET** is a student-led series of practical, hands-on sessions designed to equip learners—especially ECE and CS undergraduates—with foundational computing skills often overlooked in traditional coursework.

While university courses focus on theory and application of specific technologies, this series fills in the crucial gap: **learning how to effectively use computers as power users**, especially in Linux environments. These skills will help you debug faster, collaborate better, and become more confident in navigating real-world programming and development workflows.

Our workshops are highly interactive and designed for absolute beginners, yet provide room to explore advanced workflows and tools.

### Origins

This series is inspired by [MIT’s Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) and adapted from the version run at the University of Birmingham. However, our version is built specifically for **RUET students**, taught **by capable students**, for the benefit of peers across all years.

These sessions are organized **by students, for students**. The ECE Department and other supportive groups are kindly assisting us with logistical needs like classrooms and necessary facilities.

### Workshop Syllabus

Our current lineup includes the following topics:

1. **Linux for Beginners**
2. **Introduction to Git & GitHub**
3. **Markdown and Beyond the Basics of Git & GitHub**
4. **Debugging with VS Code & PyCharm**
5. **More Linux! (Intro to Bash & Shell Scripting)**
6. **Open-source Collaboration with GitHub**
7. **Security & Cryptography**
8. **Potpourri** (a mixed bag of advanced tips, tricks, and topics)

Workshops may evolve based on feedback and demand. Additional topics and sessions may be added in future runs.

### Who is this for?

Any RUET student—first year to final year—who is interested in becoming a more effective and independent problem-solver with their computer.

If you're curious about:

-   Working in Linux
-   Writing better code
-   Collaborating using Git
-   Debugging real-world programs
-   Contributing to open-source
-   Understanding cryptography and digital safety

…then this series is for you.

### Format and Approach

Workshops will be conducted **in person** on RUET campus in an informal, highly practical setting. All notes and materials will be made available online. We’ll also use a **Discord group** for questions, announcements, and discussions.

Each session is hosted by student instructors who have learned these tools through self-study, internships, competitive programming, or real project work. They understand the struggles of learning these concepts and will guide you step-by-step.

No exams. No grades. Just hands-on learning.

Each lecture includes live demos and optional exercises for those who want to go further.

### Requirements

We recommend attending the sessions with your **own laptop**, preferably set up with **Linux** (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, or WSL2). Help will be provided to get you set up in the first session.

### Statement on Inclusivity

This series is open to everyone. We are committed to creating a respectful, supportive, and harassment-free learning environment. Regardless of background, gender, experience level, or department—**you are welcome here**.

Let’s learn together, ask questions freely, and build a community that grows together.

### Looking Ahead

This is the **first edition** of Missing Semesters at RUET, and we hope to continue and evolve it over the coming semesters. This is just the beginning. If there is interest, we may run follow-up series, dive deeper into advanced tools, or even invite guest mentors in the future. The direction will be shaped by your feedback.

We believe that the skills you learn here will help you **beyond university**—in internships, open-source, hackathons, research, or jobs.

Let’s fill in the gaps together!
