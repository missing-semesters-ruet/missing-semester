<div class="note">
We have left this largely unchanged; it was written for MIT.  For more from a UoB context, check out our <a href="/statement_of_intent">Statement of Intent</a>.
</div>

<p>During a traditional Computer Science education, chances are you will take
plenty of classes that teach you advanced topics within CS, everything from
Operating Systems to Programming Languages to Machine Learning. But at many
institutions there is one essential topic that is rarely covered and is instead
left for students to pick up on their own: computing ecosystem literacy.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over
we have seen that many students have limited knowledge of the tools available
to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often
perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful
tools such as version control and text editors. In the best case, this results
in inefficiencies and wasted time; in the worst case, it results in issues like
data loss or inability to complete certain tasks.</p>

<p>These topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are
never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them
efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that <em>should</em> be simple.
The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing
ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier.</p>

<h1 id="the-missing-semester-of-your-cs-education">The missing semester of your CS education</h1>

<p>To help remedy this, we are running a class that covers all the topics we
consider crucial to be an effective computer scientist and programmer. The
class is pragmatic and practical, and it provides hands-on introduction to
tools and techniques that you can immediately apply in a wide variety of
situations you will encounter. The class is being run during MIT’s “Independent
Activities Period” in January 2020 — a one-month semester that features shorter
student-run classes. While the lectures themselves are only available to MIT
students, we will provide all lecture materials along with video recordings of
lectures to the public.</p>

<p>If this sounds like it might be for you, here are some concrete
examples of what the class will teach:</p>

<h2 id="command-shell">Command shell</h2>

<p>How to automate common and repetitive tasks with aliases, scripts,
and build systems. No more copy-pasting commands from a text
document. No more “run these 15 commands one after the other”. No
more “you forgot to run this thing” or “you forgot to pass this
argument”.</p>

<p>For example, searching through your history quickly can be a huge time saver. In the example below we show several tricks related to navigating your shell history for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert</code> commands.</p>

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" muted="" playsinline="" oncontextmenu="return false;" preload="auto" class="demo">
  <source src="/static/media/demos/history.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h2 id="version-control">Version control</h2>

<p>How to use version control <em>properly</em>, and take advantage of it to
save you from disaster, collaborate with others, and quickly find and
isolate problematic changes. No more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -rf; git clone</code>. No more
merge conflicts (well, fewer of them at least). No more huge blocks
of commented-out code. No more fretting over how to find what broke
your code. No more “oh no, did we delete the working code?!”. We’ll
even teach you how to contribute to other people’s projects with pull
requests!</p>

<p>In the example below we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git bisect</code> to find which commit broke a unit test and then we fix it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git revert</code>.</p>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" muted="" playsinline="" oncontextmenu="return false;" preload="auto" class="demo">

  <source src="/static/media/demos/git.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h2 id="text-editing">Text editing</h2>

<p>How to efficiently edit files from the command-line, both locally and
remotely, and take advantage of advanced editor features. No more
copying files back and forth. No more repetitive file editing.</p>

<p>Vim macros are one of its best features, in the example below we quickly convert an html table to csv format using a nested vim macro.</p>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" muted="" playsinline="" oncontextmenu="return false;" preload="auto" class="demo">

  <source src="/static/media/demos/vim.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h2 id="remote-machines">Remote machines</h2>

<p>How to stay sane when working with remote machines using SSH keys and
terminal multiplexing. No more keeping many terminals open just to
run two commands at once. No more typing your password every time you
connect. No more losing everything just because your Internet
disconnected or you had to reboot your laptop.</p>

<p>In the example below we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> to keep sessions alive in remote servers and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mosh</code> to support network roaming and disconnection.</p>

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" muted="" playsinline="" oncontextmenu="return false;" preload="auto" class="demo">
  <source src="/static/media/demos/ssh.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h2 id="finding-files">Finding files</h2>

<p>How to quickly find files that you are looking for. No
more clicking through files in your project until you find the one
that has the code you want.</p>

<p>In the example below we quickly look for files with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fd</code> and for code snippets with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rg</code>. We also quickly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> recent/frequent files/folder using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fasd</code>.</p>

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="" muted="" playsinline="" oncontextmenu="return false;" preload="auto" class="demo">
  <source src="/static/media/demos/find.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h2 id="data-wrangling">Data wrangling</h2>

<p>How to quickly and easily modify, view, parse, plot, and compute over
data and files directly from the command-line. No more copy pasting
from log files. No more manually computing statistics over data. No
more spreadsheet plotting.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual machines</h2>

<p>How to use virtual machines to try out new operating systems, isolate
unrelated projects, and keep your main machine clean and tidy. No
more accidentally corrupting your computer while doing a security
lab. No more millions of randomly installed packages with differing
versions.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>How to be on the Internet without immediately revealing all of your
secrets to the world. No more coming up with passwords that match the
insane criteria yourself. No more unsecured, open WiFi networks. No
more unencrypted messaging.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This, and more, will be covered across the 12 class lectures, each including an
exercise for you to get more familiar with the tools on your own. If you can’t
wait for January, you can also take a look at the lectures from <a href="https://hacker-tools.github.io/lectures/">Hacker
Tools</a>, which we ran during IAP last
year. It is the precursor to this class, and covers many of the same topics.</p>

<p>We hope to see you in January, whether virtually or in person!</p>

<p>Happy hacking,<br />
Anish, Jose, and Jon</p>
